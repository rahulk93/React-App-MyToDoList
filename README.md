This repository is about To Do List application in React JavaScript library. This application has the ability to store and display item. It also has remove function to 
delete items that is not requied by user. This React web application is based YouTube video called "Code your first React app | Beginner React app | To Do List" and it's 
URL is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ZibOe77yo . I watched and studied this video as part of becoming competent ReactJS web developer.

A user is not able to alter item after pressing "Add" button. However, a user can delete an item by clicking on "Remove" button.

**What I learnt while making this application above:** I learnt to create add and delete items functions.    

**How might I improve:** Redeploy this React web application again from my Visual Studios Code software so that all of my code can be seen by public. Making "Edit" 
button besides added items.
